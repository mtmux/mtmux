/**
 * Deploy the hosted stack: api.mtmux.com + app.mtmux.com.
 *
 * This exists because the three steps below are order-dependent and each one
 * fails in a way that looks like something else:
 *
 *  1. A plain `pnpm build` bakes NO NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL into apps/web — Next
 *     inlines those at build time — so the pair page renders "not configured"
 *     and the CSP blocks the broker. It also picks up NEXT_PUBLIC_RELAY_URL
 *     from .env, pointing every visitor at ws://localhost:14300 on their own
 *     machine. So the build must carry explicit env.
 *  2. `output: "standalone"` omits .next/static and public/, so a build that is
 *     not followed by prepare-standalone serves HTML that 404s its own chunks.
 *  3. Rebuilding changes chunk hashes, so the running process must be reloaded
 *     or it serves a tree that no longer matches what it hands out.
 *
 * Between steps 1 and 2 the bundle is checked for the API origin. That guard is
 * the point: every one of these failures produces a page that loads and looks
 * fine until someone tries to pair.
