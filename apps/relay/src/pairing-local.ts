/**
 * Tokenless sign-in for a device on the same network.
 *
 * `mtmux start` prints a QR encoding `http://<lan-ip>:<port>/login#n=<nonce>`.
 * Scanning it loads the login page, which redeems the nonce here for a scoped,
 * expiring session token. The 64-hex `AUTH_TOKEN` is never shown to the phone
 * and never typed by hand.
 *
 * Two properties carry the security argument:
 *
 *  - The nonce is single-use. A photo of the terminal taken after the first
 *    scan is worthless, and a redeemed nonce cannot be replayed.
 *  - Session tokens are held only in memory, so restarting the server revokes
 *    every device it ever paired. The CLI re-registers the ones it still
 *    trusts on the way back up; nothing else survives.
 *
 * A token's window is an *idle* one, not a countdown from issue: every
 * successful lookup re-stamps it. That distinction is the whole difference
 * between "a device you stopped using goes cold" and "a device you are using
 * right now stops working mid-afternoon". The 24 h default belongs to the
 * LAN-QR path, where a short window is the point; a device paired by code
 * carries the CLI's own peer lifetime instead, passed in as `ttlMs`.
 *
 * Both stores then mean the same thing — trusted unless idle for 90 days — but
 * only this one sees the traffic that proves a device is in use, which is what
 * `onSessionTokenUsed` exists to carry back.
 *
 * Nothing here is registered in split mode (apps/relay standalone), where no
 * nonce is ever issued — `redeemPairingNonce` then rejects unconditionally and
 * the endpoint is inert.
