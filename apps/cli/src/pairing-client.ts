 * The CLI half of hosted pairing, in both directions.
 *
 * `pairWithCode` is the original: the user reads a code off their phone and
 * types it here. `hostPairing` is the mirror image, which is what `mtmux start`
 * prints as a code and a QR — the CLI parks the mailbox and a browser claims
 * it, so nothing has to be typed on the machine at all.
 *
 * In both, only the leading slot digits are the broker's routing half; the rest
 * is the PAKE password. Whichever side generates the secret, it never leaves
 * that process — not to the broker, not hashed, not in a log line. Any secret a
 * human could retype is an instant offline search, so a broker that learned the
 * whole code could run the PAKE against both ends at once and hand an attacker
 * a shell.
 *
 * The exchange itself — fan-out across candidate peers, key confirmation,
 * sealing the descriptor — lives in `pairing-exchange.ts` and is shared, so the
 * two directions cannot drift apart.
