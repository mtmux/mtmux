/**
 * The loopback channel between `mtmux approve` and the running `mtmux start`.
 *
 * ## Why this is a window and not a queue
 *
 * A queue is architecturally impossible here, and it is worth writing down
 * because "just queue the requests" is the obvious first design.
 *
 * The browser's half of the SAS exchange is an ephemeral X25519 key that lives
 * only in that tab's memory. `REQUEST_TTL_MS` is 120 seconds, and the broker
 * drops the request the moment the browser's socket closes. There is nothing
 * durable to queue: a request that outlived the tab it came from could not be
 * completed by anyone, because the other half of the key exchange is gone.
 *
 * So the machine says "I am ready to approve for the next N minutes" and the
 * human then goes and clicks in the browser. The approval window is the thing
 * that persists; the request is not.
 *
 * ## Why it talks to the daemon rather than doing its own thing
 *
 * The request arrives on the *daemon's* tunnel socket. `pairRequest` routes via
 * `tunnels.byDevice`, so an approver that registered its own tunnel would
 * hijack routing from the running daemon and break every live session on it.
 * The precedent for reaching the daemon over loopback already exists — see
 * `registerDirectToken`, which POSTs to `127.0.0.1:{port}/_pair/session`.
 *
 * ## The guard
 *
 * Loopback-only plus the machine's own `AUTH_TOKEN`, compared in constant time.
 * Same shape as the relay's `localAdminOk`, and for the same reason: anything
 * that can drive this can approve a stranger's browser onto this machine.
