/**
 * The CLI's half of a pairing exchange, once a socket to the broker is open.
 *
 * Both directions of hosted pairing land here. Either the CLI claimed a code
 * the browser is showing (`mtmux pair 492716`) or the CLI is showing one and
 * the browser claimed it (`mtmux start`). The cryptography is identical; what
 * differs is only which side already sent its CPace share and therefore who
 * speaks first. That difference is the `ExchangeSide` below, and it is the only
 * thing in this file that knows the two flows exist.
 *
 * ## Fan-out
 *
 * A slot is three digits and shared on purpose, so a claim reaches every
 * live mailbox holding it and several peers may answer. Each gets its own CPace
 * run and its own key schedule; whichever produces a confirmation tag that
 * verifies is the real one, and the rest are closed — which destroys their
 * mailboxes. `outstanding` counts the peers that could still turn out to be the
 * one, so the run can fail fast the moment the last candidate is ruled out
 * instead of sitting until the timeout. It is counted from the shares that
 * arrive rather than from a total the broker promises, because a broker that
 * reports live mailbox counts is handing out an enumeration oracle.
 *
 * ## The identity labels never swap
 *
 * `confirmationTag(key, "cli")` and `verifyConfirmation(key, "browser", …)` are
 * keyed to *who* each end is, not to which of them initiated. They stay put
 * when the direction inverts. Swapping them with the role would mean the two
 * ends verify each other's tags against different strings and every pairing
 * fails — silently, and only in one direction.
