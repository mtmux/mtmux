/**
 * A second project, for the tests that need IndexedDB.
 *
 * `fake-indexeddb/auto` works in the **node** environment, so this honours the
 * main config's deliberate choice to keep jsdom out rather than quietly
 * reversing it. It is a separate project rather than a setup file on the
 * existing one so the fast suite stays exactly as fast — the lock tests do real
 * PBKDF2 and are the slowest thing in the repo.
 *
 * Run with `pnpm --filter @app/web test:idb`, and both from `pnpm test`.
