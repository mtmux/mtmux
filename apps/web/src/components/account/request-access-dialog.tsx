/**
 * "Pair this device", made to actually pair.
 *
 * The button existed and did a local IndexedDB lookup, failed, and told you to
 * go and use the other computer. `requestAccess()` — fully wired through
 * crypto, protocol, broker and CLI — had zero callers. This is the caller.
 *
 * ## Why there is no "yes, they match" button
 *
 * The six digits are a *verification* the human at the machine performs, not a
 * decision this browser makes. By the time `confirm` renders, `pair:reveal` has
 * already gone — it has to, because the SAS is derived from both public keys.
 * A button here would imply the browser is still holding something back, and
 * it is not. What the user does with the digits is read them aloud; the machine
 * is where the y/N lives.
 *
 * ## Mounted once, not per row
 *
 * The broker enforces one live request per device. N dialogs would be N ways to
 * race each other into a 409, so `ServerList` keeps a single
 * `useState<RegisteredServer | null>` and this component reads it.
