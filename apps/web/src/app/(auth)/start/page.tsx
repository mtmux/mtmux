/**
 * The front door.
 *
 * ## Why this is a code field and not a chooser
 *
 * An earlier draft made this a three-way "how do you want to connect?" menu.
 * That is the wrong shape. Both documented routes in — the banner `mtmux start`
 * prints, and the quickstart on mtmux.com — put a pairing code in the user's hand
 * *before* they open a browser. A chooser taxes the majority path with a
 * decision they have already made, in service of two minority paths that are
 * one line of text each.
 *
 * So the code field leads and everything else is a footnote underneath it.
 *
 * ## What was here before
 *
 * Nothing. `/` sent any visitor with no token and no descriptor to `/login`,
 * which asks for the self-hosted 64-hex `AUTH_TOKEN` — a credential a hosted
 * visitor has no way to obtain. Typing the documented pairing code into it opened
 * a socket to `wss://app.mtmux.com/_relay`, a route that does not exist on that
 * origin, and hung for five seconds before blaming the relay server. The page
 * that actually takes a pairing code, `/j`, was linked from nowhere.
 */

   * path exists; that one is a runtime probe and only reorders emphasis.
