/**
 * localStorage keys, and the one-time migration off the old product name.
 *
 * This app shipped as `ccremote`, then `tmuxremote`, before settling on
 * `mtmux`. The auth token key came along for the ride, so renaming it without
 * care would sign out every existing install — the token is the only thing
 * standing between a returning user and a login screen they cannot satisfy,
 * because the token lives on a machine they may not be sitting at.
 *
 * So the rename is done with a copy-forward: read the new key, fall back to the
 * old one, and promote it on first touch. After one visit the legacy key is
 * gone and this file is the only place that remembers it existed.
 *
 * Zustand's persisted stores (`ccremote-terminal`, `ccremote-commands`, …) are
 * deliberately *not* renamed. Their names are invisible, and changing one makes
 * `persist` look in a key that does not exist, silently resetting somebody's
 * font size and command history to defaults. A cosmetic rename is not worth
 * that; they can move whenever those stores next take a schema version.
