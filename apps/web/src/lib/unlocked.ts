/**
 * The only place an unlocked master key exists.
 *
 * ## Why a module variable and not storage
 *
 * Two properties fall out of this being a plain module-level binding, and
 * neither is enforced by any code — they are structural, which is the only
 * kind of guarantee worth having here:
 *
 * 1. **A cold load is always locked.** A module variable does not survive a
 *    reload. Nothing has to remember to clear it, and no bug can leave it
 *    behind.
 * 2. **Synchronous reads work.** `resolveRelayWsUrl()` and
 *    `getFileDownloadUrl()` are called during render and cannot await, which is
 *    why the session descriptor needs a synchronous mirror at all. Holding the
 *    decrypted keys in memory satisfies that constraint *without* persisting
 *    anything.
 *
 * ## What cannot be wiped
 *
 * `wipe()` zero-fills the `Uint8Array`s. The `directToken` is a JavaScript
 * **string**, and strings are immutable — there is no way to scrub one from the
 * heap. Dropping the reference is the whole of what can be done, and a heap
 * snapshot taken before GC will still contain it. Saying so here rather than
 * implying otherwise.
