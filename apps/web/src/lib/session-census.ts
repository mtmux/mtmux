/**
 * Every tmux session on every machine this browser can reach, gathered here.
 *
 * ## Why there is no `GET /v1/servers/:id/sessions`
 *
 * Because that endpoint would be a breach of invariant #2, and it is the
 * shortcut this feature invites. The broker is blind by construction: it routes
 * on a slot id and forwards sealed frames it cannot open, and it logs counts and
 * outcomes only. A dashboard endpoint returning session names would hand it —
 * and anyone with a subpoena, a backup, or a stray access log — the exact
 * mapping the design exists to deny: *this account, on this machine, is running
 * `deploy-prod` and `client-acme`.*
 *
 * The names would arrive at the broker in plaintext, because only the browser
 * and the CLI hold the pairing keys. There is no way to add such a route and
 * keep the central claim true. So the fan-out is done here, from the device that
 * already holds the keys, one short-lived authenticated connection per machine.
 * It is more code and it is slower. That is the price of the claim.
 *
 * For the same reason the cache below lives in IndexedDB rather than
 * localStorage. Session names are precisely the kind of thing that house rule
 * exists for: an XSS reads localStorage in one line.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * `runCensus` is pure orchestration — a bounded pool, a cache, a timeout and a
 * progress callback — with the per-server probe and the clock injected. That is
 * what makes it testable in the existing node-only vitest project without
 * reaching for jsdom or a fake DOM. The browser probe (`browserProbe`) is the
 * only part that touches IndexedDB and sockets, and it is assembled from pieces
 * that already exist: `raceCandidates` for the direct path and the transports
 * from `transport.ts` for the sealed tunnel.

 * This used to return `[]` the moment `paired` was empty, and to drop account

 * machines existed at all. The most common state for a new device rendered as
 * "you have nothing".
 *
 * So they are included with `paired: false`, and `runCensus` skips them
 * entirely: no socket, no cache read, no timeout budget spent. A row for one is
 * an invitation to pair, not a session list — the honest thing to show, rather
 * than nothing.
