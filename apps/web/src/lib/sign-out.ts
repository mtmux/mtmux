/**
 * Disconnect this device from the machine it is attached to.
 *
 * ## Why this is not three lines in the settings page
 *
 * The old "Logout" cleared `TOKEN_KEY` and pushed `/login`, which worked for
 * exactly one of the two ways a browser can be attached to a machine:
 *
 *  - **Self-hosted token.** Clearing localStorage really did end the session —
 *    except once a device lock was enrolled, at which point the plaintext copy
 *    is gone and the live one is a module variable in `unlocked.ts`. Clearing
 *    localStorage then removes nothing at all.
 *  - **A hosted pairing.** Nothing about it lives in localStorage. The keys and
 *    the descriptor are in IndexedDB, so the entry page would immediately
 *    `hydrateDescriptor()`, find a perfectly good session, and send the user
 *    straight back to the terminal they just tried to leave. Signing out was a
 *    round trip that changed nothing.
 *
 * So this drops all four: the socket, the in-memory token, the localStorage
 * copy, and the durable pairing for the machine currently in use.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not do
 *
 * It ends *this device's* attachment to *this machine*. It does not touch the
 * device lock, other paired machines' keys, or anything on the machine itself —
 * the tmux sessions keep running, which is the product thesis. "Erase
 * everything on this device" is a different, louder action and it lives in
 * `LockSettings`. Hence the button says **Disconnect**, not "Log out": the
 * former is honest about the scope, and the latter invites people to expect the
 * latter action.
 *
 * The census cache goes too. It is keyed by machine and holds session *names* —
 * leaving "deploy-prod, client-acme" on a device someone just disconnected
 * would be the most descriptive leftover of the lot.
