/**
 * Where a paired session lives in the browser.
 *
 * Key material goes in IndexedDB, never localStorage: an XSS can read
 * localStorage in one line, and today's 64-hex token sitting there is the
 * single worst part of the current design.
 *
 * ## Why the descriptor is in IndexedDB too
 *
 * It used to live only in sessionStorage, "so it dies with the tab" — which
 * sounded like a security property and was really just a bug. The keys survive
 * a reload in IndexedDB; the descriptor did not, so a refresh left the browser
 * holding a working key schedule with no idea where to use it and sent the user
 * back to re-pair. Nothing about candidate URLs and a tunnel id is more secret
 * than the keys that are the only way to use them.
 *
 * So the durable copy is in IndexedDB, keyed by the paired machine's device id,
 * and sessionStorage is kept as a synchronous mirror — `resolveRelayWsUrl` and
 * the `/file` URL builders are called during render and cannot await. Call
 * `hydrateDescriptor()` once on boot to refill the mirror from the durable
 * copy.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not in the durable record
 *
 * `directToken`. Not because persisting it would be new exposure — it is
 * derived from the pairing keys and `saveSessionKeys` already writes it to
 * IndexedDB under the same device id — but because a second copy is a second
 * thing to get wrong, with nothing to gain. `hydrateDescriptor` reads it back
 * out of the keys record and puts it in the tab-scoped mirror, so its
 * synchronous availability stays exactly as wide as before and its persistent
 * footprint stays exactly one record.
 */

/**
 * v2 added the descriptor store; v3 adds `lock` and `census`.

 * Every upgrade here is store creation only. **No version of this may move
 * data**: an upgrade that rewrites every record can half-fail — another tab
 * blocking the upgrade, a phone killed mid-transaction — and the half-written
 * state is a device that can no longer reach its own keys. The lock's sealed
