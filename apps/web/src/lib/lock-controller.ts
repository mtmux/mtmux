/**
 * Everything that has to happen when the device locks, in one place.
 *
 * Dropping the master key is necessary and not sufficient. A locked tab that
 * keeps an authenticated WebSocket open keeps a live capability — a lock-screen
 * XSS could drive it — and an xterm buffer that is merely hidden is still in
 * the DOM. So locking also disconnects, clears the tab-scoped descriptor
 * mirror, and empties the stores whose contents came off the machine.
 *
 * **It does not kill the tmux session.** tmux durability is the product thesis;
 * a lock that ended your work would be a worse feature than no lock.
 *
 * The reconnect path needs no new code: `TerminalView`'s status effect already
 * re-drives exactly one `session:attach` with `capture: true` when the socket
 * comes back, and `session:attach` is already in `DROP_WHEN_DISCONNECTED`. The
 * cost of locking and unlocking again is ~200–800 ms and a repaint.
