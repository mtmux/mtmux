/**
 * The device lock, as encryption at rest.
 *
 * A lock that is only a UI overlay is worthless: the keys sit in IndexedDB and
 * one line in devtools reads them. So enrolling seals every key record under a
 * master key that exists only in memory, and locking is dropping that key.
 *
 * ## What this does and does not protect against
 *
 * It protects against **a person holding your unlocked phone for the next few
 * minutes** — the realistic threat, which it handles well.
 *
 * It does **not** protect against someone who copies your IndexedDB and takes
 * it home. A 6-digit PIN behind PBKDF2-600k is roughly 16,000 guesses/s on one
 * consumer GPU, which exhausts the space in about a minute offline. That number
 * belongs in the UI, not just in this comment. Only the passkey factor, whose
 * PRF secret has 256 bits of entropy and never leaves the authenticator, defends
 * against the copy-it-and-leave attack.
 *
 * ## Why the throttle lives in the record
 *
 * In memory it would reset on reload, which is one keystroke away. And it is
 * incremented **before** the verification attempt, so killing the tab
 * mid-verify does not dodge the counter.
