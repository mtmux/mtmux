/**
 * A signed-in user on a device that has never paired with anything.
 *
 * This is the single most common state for a new phone, and it rendered as
 * "you have nothing": `collectTargets()` returned `[]` the moment the browser
 * held no pairings, so someone with ten registered machines opened the
 * dashboard to an empty list with nothing on it to act on.
 *
 * The dashboard needs both a signed-in session and a broker, neither of which
 * `pnpm dev` has, so everything the page reads is stubbed at the network edge.
 * That is the point: what is under test is what the browser does with two
 * machines and no keys, not whether the broker returns them.
