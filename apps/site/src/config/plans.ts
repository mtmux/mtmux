/**
 * Plan limits and prices, mirrored for the marketing site.
 *
 * **The source of truth is `packages/config/src/plans.ts`** (`@repo/config/plans`),
 * which the broker actually enforces. This file exists only because `@app/site`
 * does not depend on `@repo/config` — the marketing site is deployed on its own
 * and adding a workspace dependency for four numbers is not worth the coupling.
 *
 * If the two ever disagree, `packages/config/src/plans.ts` wins, and this file
 * is the bug. Anything shown on /pricing must be traceable to a value here.
 *
 * The authoritative prices live in Dodo Payments; these render the page without
 * a network call. The checkout a customer actually sees is Dodo's.
