/**
 * The frame: header, scrolling body, footer, inside the safe area.
 *
 * The height is `--vv-height` — the *visual* viewport — with `100dvh` as the
 * fallback for anything that has not published one yet (`VisualViewportSync`
 * sets it on `:root`). That distinction is the whole reason this comment
 * exists. `interactiveWidget: "resizes-content"` shrinks the layout viewport
 * when the soft keyboard opens, so `100dvh` alone is correct on Chromium and
 * wrong on iOS Safari, which does not implement it: there the box stayed full
 * height and the entire footer — command bar, keyboard toolbar and all — sat
 * underneath the keyboard. The one row that exists *because* the keyboard is
 * up was the one row you could not reach.
 *
 * `CommandComposer` already sized itself this way for the same reason; this is
 * that fix applied where the footer actually lives. On Chromium the two agree,
 * because `--vv-height` and the shrunk `100dvh` are the same number.
