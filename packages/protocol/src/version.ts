/**
 * The pairing protocol's version, on the wire.
 *
 * Until 0.7.0 there was none. Nothing in `packages/protocol` carried a version
 * except the at-rest formats — `recordings.ts` and `grants.ts` — so the broker
 * could not identify, warn, or refuse a client by version. That is the same
 * gap as having no kill switch: a release that turned out to be dangerous
 * would have stayed in the field, because there was no channel through which
 * to say so and no way to stop it pairing.
 *
 * ## Why it exists now
 *
 * 0.7.0 breaks the wire in two ways that a client cannot detect for itself. The
 * pairing code went from a two-digit slot to three, so a 0.6.x code routes
 * somewhere real and derives a different key — which reads to the user as a
 * wrong code, repeatedly, for as long as they retry. And sealed frames moved to
 * a per-connection subkey, so a 0.6.x peer's frames simply fail to open. Both
 * failures are silent and both look like the *other* side being broken. A floor
 * turns them into one sentence: update mtmux.
 *
 * ## What the numbers mean
 *
 * `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is what this build speaks. `MIN_PROTOCOL_VERSION` is the
 * lowest a broker built from this source accepts by default. They are equal at
 * 2 because 0.7.0 is a clean break: version 1 is every client that sent no `v`
 * at all, and none of them can complete a pairing against this broker.
 *
 * A self-hoster must be able to change or disable this — see the broker's
 * `minProtocolVersion` config, where zero means "refuse nothing". A floor is a
 * control over other people's software, and the people running a broker for
 * themselves should hold it rather than inherit ours.
