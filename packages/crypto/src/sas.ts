/**
 * Short-authentication-string pairing, for "let me onto that machine" from a
 * dashboard rather than from a code someone is standing in front of.
 *
 * The same construction as Bluetooth numeric comparison, ZRTP and Matrix SAS
 * verification: two ephemeral X25519 keys, a commitment that fixes one of them
 * before the other is revealed, and six digits derived from the agreed secret
 * that a human compares across two screens.
 *
 * ## Why this is stronger than a typed code, not weaker
 *
 * There is no secret to guess. An attacker needs the victim's authenticated
 * account session *and* a human pressing `y` at the victim's own keyboard. What
 * the SAS defends against is the one party in the middle of the exchange: the
 * broker. It forwards both ephemeral keys and could substitute its own.
 *
 * The commitment is what makes that detectable rather than merely hard.
 *
 *   1. The browser sends only `commitment = H(EB ‖ requestId)`.
 *   2. The CLI replies with its own `EC`, having seen no key yet.
 *   3. Only then does the browser reveal `EB`, and the CLI checks the
 *      commitment.
 *
 * Substituting `EC` changes the SAS the browser computes, so the two screens
 * disagree. Substituting `EB` fails the commitment check outright. Committing
 * *before* seeing `EC` is the load-bearing part: without it, a broker could
 * grind candidate keys until it found one whose SAS matched what the browser
 * would show. With it, the attack is a single online 1-in-10^6 guess that a
 * human sees fail.
 *
 * The broker never sees either private key, and never sees the descriptor
 * plaintext. It learns that a request happened, which it must not write down.
