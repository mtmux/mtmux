/**
 * The device-lock envelope — encryption at rest for the browser's key material.
 *
 * A lock that is only a UI overlay is worthless: the pairing keys sit in
 * IndexedDB and devtools reads them in one line. So the lock is real
 * encryption, arranged as one master key and a wrap per unlock factor:
 *
 *     MK (32 random bytes, never persisted in the clear)
 *      ├─ wrapped once per factor:  WK   = HKDF-SHA-256(FK, info="… wrap|kind|id")
 *      │                            blob = AES-256-GCM(WK, fresh nonce, aad, MK)
 *      └─ seals every secret record directly, under MK
 *
 * There is deliberately no intermediate DEK layer. The only reason one usually
 * exists is rewrapping on a factor change, and that is already satisfied here —
 * adding or removing a factor touches the wrapped-MK blobs and nothing else.
 *
 * Three decisions in here are load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **AES-GCM comes from `@noble/ciphers`, unconditionally.** `crypto.subtle`
 *    does not exist on `http://192.168.x.x` — it is secure-context only, and
 *    `mtmux start` prints exactly such a LAN URL. A branch in the code that
 *    must never be wrong is a branch that can be wrong, so there is not one.
 *    Records are ~150 bytes; the pure-JS penalty is microseconds.
 *
 * 2. **`seal()` takes no nonce.** It generates a fresh 12-byte random nonce on
 *    every single call. Reusing a nonce under one GCM key leaks the
 *    authentication key outright and lets an attacker forge *any* record, not
 *    just replay one — so the API makes the mistake unexpressible rather than
 *    merely discouraged.
 *
 * 3. **AAD is mandatory and binds each ciphertext to its slot.** An attacker
 *    with IndexedDB *write* access can move bytes around freely; without AAD
 *    they could relocate machine A's sealed keys into machine B's slot and have
 *    the app decrypt them happily. With it, the tag fails.
 *
 * Verification is the GCM tag and nothing else. A wrong PIN derives a wrong WK,
 * which fails the tag. There is no separate verifier blob to leak an oracle.
 *
 * PBKDF2 is the one place this file prefers WebCrypto (see `derivePinKey`),
 * because there the 10–30× pure-JS penalty *is* the brute-force resistance.
 *
 * **What cannot be wiped.** `wipe()` zero-fills the `Uint8Array`s it is given,
 * which is the best JS offers. It does nothing for strings: `SessionKeys`'
 * `directToken` is a JS string, and once one exists it stays in the heap until
 * the GC feels like it — unreachable, but not erased, and not something the
 * program can force. Anything that must be wipeable has to be bytes.
