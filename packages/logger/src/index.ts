/**
 * Where log lines go.
 *
 * `LOG_FILE` exists for one reason: inside the `mtmux` CLI the relay runs in
 * the same process as the banner and writes to the same fd. Every pane click,
 * split, resize and window switch produced a line of raw NDJSON — pid and
 * hostname included, because production skips pino-pretty — straight through
 * the QR code. The CLI's own output is a dozen lines that have to survive; the
 * relay's is a debugging aid that does not have to be on screen at all.
 *
 * `pino.destination` rather than a transport, deliberately. Transports spawn a
 * worker thread and resolve their target by module path, and neither survives
 * being bundled by esbuild into `dist/relay/runtime.js` — the CLI would start
 * and then die on its first log line.
 *
 * `sync: false` because a terminal server must never block on a disk write, and
 * `mkdir` because `~/.mtmux/logs` does not exist on a first run.
